            While most of my professional work has been proprietary and confidential, at KEPRO I developed and maintained a public facing web site:
            <br /><br />
            <a href="http://www.keproqio.com" target="_blank">http://www.keproqio.com</a>
            <br />
             I worked with the marketing department, including a graphic designer, to design the site and I performed all development and implementation.  The site was developed as an ASP.NET web site with Visual Basic as the code-behind language and Microsoft SQL Server as the backend database.  This site was developed some time ago.  However, most of my original programming remains intact.
