          <h2>Biography</h2>
          <br />
          I began programming computers in the 6th grade.  This was the start of a lifelong love of computers and technology.
          <br /><br />
          I have approximately 7 years of software development experience that includes web development, Microsoft Windows forms applications and console applications.  I have worked in several languages including C# and Visual basic.  I also have a strong background in SQL and relational database design and implementation.  I have experience in various web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
          <br /><br />
          In addition to my software development skills, I have a degree in Public Relations.  This unique combination of skills has made me a valuable asset to organizations as a liaison between technical and communications teams.  At Bozell Public Relations, I had the opportunity to write a presentation for Microsoft Founder and former CEO Bill Gates which was used at a healthcare conference at which Mr. Gates spoke about our client for 8 minutes.
          <br /><br />
          On a personal level, my hobbies include movies, music and computer gaming.  I enjoy traveling, particularly cruises, and have traveled extensively throughout the Caribbean.
